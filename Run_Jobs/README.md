# run_en_br_prs.py
 Train and save PGS models using EN and BR on UKB data, and internally test these models and UNI method on the excluded UKB data.

# run_en_br_prs_external.py
  Externally test the previously EN or BR-trained PGS models, and UNI method on the whole INTERVAL data.  

# run_mlp.py
  Train and save PGS models using MLP (using the MLP structure selected previously via a validation step) on UKB data, and internally test these models on the excluded UKB data.

# run_mlp_external.py
  Externally test the previously MLP-trained PGS model on the whole INTERVAL data.

# run_cnn.py
 Train and save PGS models using CNN (using the CNN structure selected previously via a validation step) on UKB data, and internally test these models on the excluded UKB data.

# run_cnn_external.py
  Externally test the previously CNN-trained PGS model on the whole INTERVAL data.
