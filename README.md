# Utls
 Various utility functions that are used in the above codes.  
 
 # NN Structures
 Files that store the selected top 10 MLP and CNN structures from validation step.
 
 # requirement.txt
 Python environment configuration used for runing the ML/DL methods (under **Methods**).
 
 The required R packages for methods under **Updated_Methods** are given in their scripts.
